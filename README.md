# Sudoku-olcPGE
A basic sudoku game with options for 4x4 or 9x9 and different difficulty levels. Written in C++ using the olcPixelGameEngine created by javidx9.

Created for fun as a learning project - I used the C++ Standard Library for nearly everything outside of drawing the game to the screen.

Includes a small modification to the olcPGE for easier access to the keyboard state.

It's not the best-looking game, but it is functional!
